# SQL Fuel Management System Project

## Overview

This SQL project encompasses a series of exercises aimed at constructing a comprehensive database schema for a fuel management system. The project demonstrates proficiency in database creation, schema design, and data integrity enforcement through various SQL features.

## Project Structure and Exercises

### Exercise 1: Database and Schema Creation
- **Objective**: Initialize `pec2` database and create `erp` schema to house the project's tables.
- **Key Actions**: Establishment of foundational database environment for subsequent table creation and data management activities.

### Exercise 2: Table Definitions and Relationships
- **Objective**: Define a series of tables (`tb_cars`, `tb_gas_station`, `tb_pump`, `tb_fuel_price`, `tb_refueling`, `tb_invoice`, `tb_lines_invoice`) essential for managing vehicle information, gas stations, fuel pricing, refueling records, and invoicing.
- **Key Actions**: Implementation of tables with primary and foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity and relational data structure. Includes setting default values and assigning table ownership.

### Exercise 3: Data Integrity and Management
- **Objective**: Ensure robust data integrity and ease of management through careful definition of foreign key constraints, default values, and ownership assignment.
- **Key Actions**: Configuration of constraints to enforce relational integrity across tables, establishment of defaults for streamlined data entry, and assignment of ownership for database management purposes.

## Usage

The provided SQL scripts are designed for execution in a PostgreSQL environment, setting up the necessary structures for a comprehensive fuel management system.
